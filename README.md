This is a simple aircraft game. We mainly contributed to shaders and the main.cpp.

The goal of this game is to collect all gold in the rock ring, and when the goal is reached, the texture of the aircraft will turned into gold. To collect gold, you only need to get close enough to it.

Meanwhile, you need to avoid to "meet" the local crafts because they will turned into red if you run into them.

There are also some tools we designed to help you make the collection and exploration easier: The speed coin and rockets:

You can collect both of them. Collecting coin will unlock the **Speed Mode** of the aircraft, and collect rockets will allow you to shoot them. If the local craft is shot, it will disappear.
